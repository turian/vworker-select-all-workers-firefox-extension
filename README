vWorker Select All Workers
==========================

DESCRIPTION
===========

vWorker Select All Workers is an extension for Mozilla Firefox that
allows automatic selection for inviting all the coders on the vWorker.com
site. 

USAGE
=====

By default, the extension selects all the coders on the vWorker.com results
page automatically without requiring intervention of the user. This 
behaviour can be modify by clicking on the status bar icon, and unchecking 
the "Execute automatically" checkbox.

The status bar icon menu provides other two items that select / unselect 
the coders on the page manually. These two options are only enabled when the 
user is visiting a vWorker.com results page.

PACKAGING
=========

For packaging the extension's files and produce the resulting .xpi file,
a simple Makefile for the 'make' tool is provided. On Linux, the following
instructions build 'vworkerextension.xpi' under the working directory
(the 'zip' command needs to available installed):

$ make package

Alternatively, the .xpi file can be created manually by using the 'zip'
command directly, or any other zipping software. The resulting .xpi file
should contain the following files:

chrome/content/ff-overlay.js
chrome/content/ff-overlay.xul
chrome/skin/statusbaricon.png
chrome/locale/en-US/overlay.dtd
install.rdf
chrome.manifest

Under linux, the following instructions build the .xpi file:

$ cd src
$ zip -r ../vworkerextension.xpi install.rdf chrome.manifest chrome


INSTALLATION
============

The extension can be installed by drag-and-dropping the 'vworkerextension.xpi'
file over an existing Firefox window, or by pointing Firefox to the local URL
where the file is stored.

For example, if the file is stored in '/tmp/vworkerextension.xpi', the 
browser should be pointed to 'file:///tmp/vworkerextension.xpi'.
